## Project Overview

This Finance Tracker app allows users to add, view, and filter financial transactions, providing a clear overview of their total balance, income, and expenses. The app uses localStorage to persist data and Chart.js to visualize income versus expenses in a pie chart.

## The Why

The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a simple yet effective tool to manage their personal finances. By tracking income and expenses, users can better understand their spending habits and make informed financial decisions.

## User & Business Goals

- Enable users to easily add and categorize financial transactions.
- Provide clear visual summaries of financial data.
- Allow filtering of transactions by type (Income or Expense).
- Persist data locally for convenience without requiring backend setup.
- Offer a clean, user-friendly interface accessible on various devices.

## (UX) User Experience

Users can quickly add new transactions via a modal form, view recent transactions in a table, and filter them by type. The dashboard displays total balance, income, and expenses, along with a pie chart for visual comparison.

## Testing

### Testing Overview

The Finance Tracker application has been thoroughly tested using both automated unit tests and manual testing procedures to ensure reliability and user experience.

### Automated Testing

#### Unit Tests with Jest

All core business logic has been tested using Jest with the jsdom environment. Tests cover:

**Test Suite: Finance Tracker Logic (TDD)**

1. **Empty State Test**
   - **Test**: `should start with empty transactions if nothing saved`
   - **Purpose**: Ensures application starts with clean state when no data exists
   - **Result**: âœ… PASS

2. **Add Transaction Test**
   - **Test**: `should add a transaction and save it`
   - **Purpose**: Verifies transactions are properly added and persisted to localStorage
   - **Result**: âœ… PASS

3. **Financial Calculations Test**
   - **Test**: `should calculate total income, expenses, and balance correctly`
   - **Purpose**: Ensures accurate financial calculations across multiple transactions
   - **Test Data**: 
     - Income: Â£3000 (Salary) + Â£500 (Bonus) = Â£3500
     - Expenses: Â£1000 (Rent)
     - Expected Balance: Â£2500
   - **Result**: âœ… PASS

4. **Transaction Filtering Test**
   - **Test**: `should filter transactions by type`
   - **Purpose**: Verifies filtering functionality works correctly for Income, Expense, and All categories
   - **Result**: âœ… PASS

#### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

All tests use the `@jest-environment jsdom` configuration to simulate browser localStorage APIs.
