# ðŸ’° Finance Tracker

A responsive web application to help users track their income and expenses, visualize their financial status with charts, and manage transactions easily through an intuitive interface.

## Project Overview

This Finance Tracker app allows users to add, view, and filter financial transactions, providing a clear overview of their total balance, income, and expenses. The app uses localStorage to persist data and Chart.js to visualize income versus expenses in a pie chart.
